## A Cute Fun Experiment with Vibe Coding

Welcome to **Canvas**, a playful and interactive app that turns your digital to-do list into a dynamic, aesthetic bulletin board. This project is one of my fun experiments, focusing on creating a delightful front-end experience with a lot of vibe and creativity. I wanted to see how a simple productivity tool could feel more personal and artistic.

## Live Demo

**Note**: This is a front-end showcase only. It does not have a database, so your pinned items will disappear when you close or refresh the page.
